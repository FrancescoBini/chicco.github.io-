            <h1>Francesco Bini</h1>
            <h2>Founder, Statistician, and Blockchain Passionate</h2>
            <p class="bio">
                With a foundation in Statistics from the University of Bologna, I’m a strategist who thrives on leveraging data to drive impactful decisions. My journey began with a deep interest in data science, which I’ve applied across roles in the tech and blockchain spaces. I’ve led marketing and product strategies that combine rigorous statistical analysis with a creative approach, resulting in measurable growth and engagement.
                <br><br>
                In my recent role as <strong>Chief Marketing Officer</strong> at Kresus, a Web3 wallet platform, I used data-driven insights to spearhead a pivotal product shift that increased engagement by +1350% while improving budget efficiency by 87.5%. My work included developing analytics tools to measure user trends and collaborating with partners like Christie’s and WorldCoin to expand Kresus' reach within the crypto community.
                <br><br>
                My analytical journey also includes creating a Python program that correlates stock prices of S&P 500 companies with Google query data, a project that increased an AI-driven investment model’s profitability by 8%. I bring a unique blend of statistical rigor and industry insight, bridging the gap between raw data and strategic action, especially in fast-evolving fields like Web3 and blockchain.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not digging into data or exploring crypto trends, I enjoy tracking and analyzing my own productivity metrics, continually applying statistical methods to optimize my lifestyle.
